			<h2>Why do cats make great pets?</h2><br>
			<ol>
				<li>CATS ARE QUIET.
				<p>Well, some cats may be a bit noisy, but most of them are silent. 
				The only thing you have to worry about is them knocking over your stuff.</p>
				<li>CATS ARE LOW-MAINTENANCE.
				<p>You don't need to take them outside multiple times a day. They also are able to clean themselves. Though it's 
				not as clean as when you groom them, but it's good enough (unless you have long-haired cats, they do need regular grooming :> ).</p>
				<li>CATS ARE INDEPENDENT.
				<p>Cats don't require a lot of attention, they're already happy knowing that you are there. Also, they sleep a lot so 
				you don't need to worry about them being too bored.</p>
				<li>CATS KEEP PESTS OUT.
				<p>They scare away mice, bugs, or others. You wouldn't need to spend more for mouse traps and other stuff.</p>
				<li>CATS LIVE FOR A LONG TIME.
				<p>Cats have an average lifespan of 12 years! And that doesn't mean that they can't live longer than that.
				This means that you most probably won't suffer a heartbreaking experience of losing your pet.</p>
